# Welcome to the MosaeZorg Data Hub!



Odinn's Auga:
Harnessing the power of satellite data and quantum computing to revolutionize pathogen research and drug discovery. We provide access to real-time and near real-time satellite imagery, empowering researchers, scientists, educators, and citizen scientists to gain insights into pathogen evolution, environmental factors, and potential disease outbreaks.

## About the Project

The MosaeSat(TM) hub is an open-source project that aims to accelerate biomedical research by leveraging the unique capabilities of satellite data and quantum computing. By aggregating live streams and near real-time data from various satellite missions, we're creating a platform for:

* **Real-time Disease Surveillance:**  Monitor potential disease outbreaks and track the spread of pathogens in real time.
* **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Understand how environmental factors influence pathogen evolution and transmission.
* **Drug Discovery:** Utilize quantum computing to analyze pathogen genomes and accelerate the development of new therapeutics.
* **Community Collaboration:** Foster a global community of researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals working together to tackle infectious diseases.

**Our Vision:** We envision a future where satellite data and quantum computing play a pivotal role in disease prevention, early detection, and the development of effective treatments.
